title: "About Indexy"
description: "Indexy's mission is to simplify tracking, investing, and learning about crypto markets. Today, following crypto markets is outdated. With new sectors emerging across multiple blockchains, tracking individual coins isn't enough. We need smarter tools to spot trends, reduce risk, and understand market dynamics clearly."

## What's an Index?

In traditional finance, an index is a collection of assets grouped to represent a market segment, such as the S&P 500 for stocks. Indexes provide a clearer view of market trends and reduce risk through diversification.

## Our Indices

Our indices are designed for crypto hobbyists, amateur traders, seasoned investors, and institutional funds, each with specific goals:

- **Market Tracking & Benchmarking:**\
  Follow market segments to identify trends clearly and quickly.
- **Discover New Assets:**\
  Exploring indices is an effective way to find emerging assets and projects.
- **Investment Strategies:**\
  Leverage indices to build data-driven diversification strategies, helping reduce risks and optimize returns.

### Indexes Attributes

#### Distribution

Distribution defines how assets within an index are weighted. The weighting method impacts an index’s performance and risk profile.

Current distribution types include:

- **Market Caps:**

  Indexes that weight assets based on their market capitalization — ideal for tracking overall market trends and identifying dominant players.
- **Custom Weights:**

  Indexes with manually assigned weights per asset — useful for thematic exposure, strategy-driven portfolios, or emphasizing niche sectors regardless of size.

#### Categories

Indexy assigns each asset to tailored categories, allowing indices to focus on specific segments or combine multiple categories.

Current categories include:

- DeFi
- AI
- Memecoins
- Real World Assets (RWA)
- Art
- NFTs
- Infrastructure
- Social
- Games

#### Blockchains

Indexy tracks assets across multiple blockchains (L1s and L2s). Our indices can include assets from different blockchains simultaneously.

#### Assets

Indices can track fungible tokens and, soon, other asset types like NFTs, apps, and off-chain assets.

- **Fungible Tokens**
- **Non-Fungible Tokens:** _(Coming Soon)_

### Index Management

Index management determines how assets within an index are adjusted over time, directly influencing the index's performance, risk, and accuracy in tracking market segments.

Regular **rebalancing** is crucial. It ensures the index reflects market dynamics by adjusting asset allocations, maintaining diversification, and controlling risk exposure.

Current management strategies include:

#### Manual

Assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted by the index owner (Indexy or third parties).

#### AI-powered Management _(Coming Soon)_

Assets and weightings are automatically adjusted using AI-driven analytics to optimize performance.

## KPIs

Our KPIs measure index performance through advanced calculations. Unlike basic metrics such as market cap or volume, KPIs have unique characteristics ideal for comparisons and informed decision-making.

### KPI Attributes

#### Composability

KPIs combine multiple metrics to provide robust indicators not easily found in standard blockchain analytics platforms.

#### Weighted Importance

Each metric is assigned an importance level based on the specific KPI's goal.

#### Time-Based

KPIs reflect performance over various periods (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year).

#### Normalized Scores

Each KPI is normalized into a single, easy-to-understand score (eg: numerical: 0 to 10, readable levels: High, Low).

### Our KPIs

#### Mindshare

Mindshare is a composite metric designed to track the visibility and engagement of assets, indexes, and blockchains on Indexy. It reflects how often something appears or is interacted with, offering a snapshot of what's gaining attention in the ecosystem.

**Scores**

1. **Top of Mind** - ≥ 2.1%
   - Highest level indicating dominant mindshare
   - Brain emoji represents mental prominence
2. **High** - 1.0% to 2.0%
   - Strong mindshare presence
   - Green circle indicates positive performance
3. **Medium** - 0.1% to 0.9%
   - Moderate mindshare level
   - Yellow circle shows average awareness
4. **Low** - \< 0.1%
   - Minimal mindshare presence
   - Red circle indicates low awareness

**Time Ranges**

- 24H (recent)
- 1W (primary)
- 1M (mid-term)
- 3M (longer-term)

#### - Asset Mindshare

Measures how frequently each asset (coin) appears across all indices:

- Tracks the number of times an asset is included in indices.
- Calculates its share of total inclusions as a percentage.

#### - Indexes Mindshare

Captures how prominent and engaged each index is, using both composition and user interaction.

- **Asset Composition Score (50%)**: Based on the mindshare of its assets, weighted by their market cap or custom weights.
- **Engagement Score (50%)**: Based on index views and number of users tracking it.

#### - Chains Mindshare

Tracks activity-driven visibility of each blockchain based on recent index creation and asset addition.

- Counts how often coins from a blockchain are used in new indices or logged events over the past 7 days.
- Calculates the blockchain’s share of total recent activity.

#### Volatility

Measures price stability or fluctuations of an index within a set period. Lower volatility suggests stability, while higher volatility indicates potential risks or rewards.

**Scores**

1. **Stable** - ≥ 9.0
   - Highest level indicating very low volatility
2. **Moderate** - 6.0 to 8.9
   - Medium volatility level
3. **Volatile** - 3.0 to 5.9
   - High volatility with significant price swings
4. **Extreme** - \< 3.0
   - Highest volatility with extreme price movements

#### vs. Bitcoin Strength

Measures how an index performs compared to Bitcoin over a given period. A positive score indicates the index is outperforming Bitcoin, providing insight into relative strength and market sentiment.

**Score**

Ranging from 0.00 (lowest strength) to 10.00 (maximum strength).

#### All-Time High (ATH)

Measures the current price performance of the index against its historical maximum value. This indicates how far an index is trading from its peak.

**Score**

Ranging from 0.00 (all-time low) to 10.00 (all-time high).
